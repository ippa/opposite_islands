A small game for rubyweekend #2. I was on vacation so I put maybe 8 hours into this.
I made this all by myself. Graphics with inkscape, sounds from freesounds.org, edited with audacity.


Gameplay
========
Kill the enemies opposite of you.
A red circle marks the selected unit. 
Units and bullets will wrap around when hitting the screenborder (use this to your advantage)

You can only kill units in the air.
A bullet costs you 1 point, so dont put all your units on autofire just for the sake of it
Only your bullet kills enemies -- only enemybullet kills your units.
Your different units have different speeds, firepower, firespeed and health, find out what to use against what.

Keys
====
TAB: Select the next unit
Shift+TAB: Select the previous unit
SPACE: Start the unit (if on the ground) or toggle autofire (if in the air)
LEFT KEY: Turn left
RIGHT KEY: Turn right


Goal
====
Kill the enemies, get alot of points (which you can compare with others)


Comming
=======
2-player mode could be fun :) should be very easy to implement.
